# matthewFrontierApp
the project for frontier hacks
Idea: A web app for People to look at venues for taking shelter when in distress and homeless
How it will help: When people are in distress they will take a look at the app and it will inform them of the closest shelter near them within a 3 mile radius
Companies and institutions can apply and old shelters
Can be useful during a crisis maybe a wild fire or flood or homelessness
