# Find My Shelter
## What Is the problem?
Many people are homeless and living on the streets with very little food, protection, and education.  
 
Others lose their homes in a natural disaster like a wild fire or a tsunami. Without a home or a place to live, they can become ill and hurt.
 
It is hard for these people to come to know about shelters or places to take refugee.  
 
## Why is this important?
 
Currently in California, 33 out of 10,000 are homeless. Thats 130,000 homeless people in California. That is the most in the whole country! Homelessess is a huge problem in America and it needs to be solved. Leaving people on the streets with no care is inhumane. Leaving people suffering from natural disasters stuffed in small unusable areas is horrible. They don't deserve this treatment. They need a place to relax and eat. They need care and places to learn and get jobs.
